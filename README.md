# Handmade Hero
Building all the architecture necessary to make a game written entirely in C/C++. I am following Casey Muratori's epic 400+ episode series [Handmade Hero](https://www.handmadehero.org/) as a reference, which documents how to actually build a fully functioning game engine from scratch.

* Build my own Win32 application
* Build my own software renderer using SIMD
* Build my own audio mixer
* Build my own asset streaming system
* Build my own debug system
* No SDL, No OpenGL, no DirectX

## Why make a game from scratch?

> "It's important for game developers who are going to be serious programmers to learn everything about how a game works." - Casey Muratori

I want to get into, and get excited about the underlying technology I use as software engineer: cache miss, throughput, cycles, multithreading, and more. I also greatly enjoy Casey's grumpy rants about Bjarne Stroustrup.
